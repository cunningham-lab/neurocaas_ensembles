Repo Organization
=================

This repo is organized as follows: 

.. code-block:: bash

   /
   |-README.md
   |-requirements.txt
   |-docs/
   |-scripts/
   |-src/
   |-data/
     |-ibl/
     |-ibl_data/
     |-erica_data/
     |-fishdata

Most of the organization is pretty straightforward. The only interesting part is `data`, where :code:`ibl`/`ibl_data` includes data from the ibl dataset, `erica_data` contains the twomouse dataset, and `fishdata` contains the Bendesky fighting fish dataset.
